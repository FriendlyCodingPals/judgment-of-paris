Contributors to Judgment of Paris may optionally add themselves to this list of
authors if they choose to do so. This is optional because the git history is
good enough for that purpose, and in fact most projects do not maintain such a
manual list.

While the file is not necessary, to preserve the history of the project we are
not removing it.

(Authors keep copyright of their contributions, of course; they just grant
a license to everyone to use it as detailed in LICENSE.)
